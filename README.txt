Lottery Generator

Single Page Application (SPA) for a lottery game system.

System allows users to access the index page (index.jsp) from an updated Google Chrome or Firefox browser. Each lottery game starts with a randomly generated winning number. From the index, the user inputs their age, number of times to play on that day, and the series of numbers they wish to play.

Players MUST be older than 18.
Players may play a MAXIMUM of 5 numbers per day. Players must then wait 24 hours before they can play again.
A winning number displays a congratulatory message and resets the lottery system.
